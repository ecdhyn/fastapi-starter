### Prompt 

Serving as an instruction for an LLM, prompts are subdivided into DeveloperPrompts and Prompts: DeveloperPrompts have an id and prompt_content, while Prompts act as an extension of
DeveloperPrompts and include a display_name and parent/children prompts to keep track of revision history.

Prompts also have prompt variables! Prompt variables allow contextual information, conditional statements, and data that changes often to be updated dynamically -- 
you don't have to change the prompt every time your menu changes. These also have categories (tbd)

### Test 

Tests exist to evaluate the quality of prompts by testing performance on specific metrics. There exist four major types: exact match, RegEx, Semantic Similarity, and JSON Validity.
You can think of these as the "unit tests" of our prompt manager.

### Transcript Evaluation

Transcript Evaluations gauge the quality of prompts by taking transcripts from calls and evaluating how the system prompt did. A score is given that ranges from 0 to 1 as a decimal value.
